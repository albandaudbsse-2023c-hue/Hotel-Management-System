Hotel Management System (HMS)
1. Overview
The Hotel Management System (HMS) is a software application designed to automate and manage the core operations of a hotel. The system aims to replace manual, paper-based processes with a centralized digital solution that improves efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. HMS integrates room management, customer records, booking, billing, and reporting into a single platform.
2. Introduction
In the hospitality industry, efficient management of reservations, guests, rooms, and services is critical for smooth operations. Traditional manual systems are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. A Hotel Management System provides a structured and automated approach to managing hotel activities, enabling staff to focus more on customer service rather than administrative tasks.
This project focuses on developing a basic yet scalable HMS that can be used by small to medium-sized hotels to manage daily operations effectively.
3. Problem Statement
Many hotels still rely on manual or semi-automated systems for managing reservations, guest information, and billing. These approaches lead to several problems, including:
•	Duplicate or lost customer records
•	Overbooking or incorrect room allocation
•	Delays in check-in and check-out processes
•	Billing errors and lack of transparency
•	Difficulty in generating reports and tracking hotel performance
There is a need for a reliable, centralized system that can handle hotel operations efficiently and accurately.
4. Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is a Hotel Management System that automates hotel operations through a user-friendly interface. The system maintains a centralized database for rooms, guests, reservations, and payments. It allows hotel staff to perform tasks such as booking rooms, checking guests in and out, generating bills, and viewing reports with minimal effort.
The system ensures data consistency, reduces human errors, and improves overall operational efficiency.
5. Functional Requirements
The functional requirements define what the system should do.
5.1 User Management
•	The system shall allow authorized staff to log in securely.
•	The system shall support different user roles (e.g., admin, receptionist).
5.2 Room Management
•	The system shall store room details (room number, type, price, status).
•	The system shall display room availability in real time.
5.3 Reservation Management
•	The system shall allow creating.
•	The system shall prevent double booking of rooms.
5.4 Guest Management
•	The system shall store guest information (name, contact details, ID).
5.5 Check-In and Check-Out
•	The system shall support guest check-in and check-out processes.
•	The system shall automatically update room status.
6. Non-Functional Requirements
The non-functional requirements describe system quality attributes.
6.1 Usability
•	The system shall be easy to use with a simple and intuitive interface.
6.2 Performance
•	The system shall respond to user actions within an acceptable time limit.
6.3 Security
•	The system shall restrict access using authentication.
•	The system shall protect sensitive customer and payment data.
6.4 Reliability
•	The system shall ensure data consistency and prevent data loss.
6.5 Scalability
•	The system shall support future enhancements such as online booking and mobile access.






















7. Screenshots of Code Output
This section includes screenshots demonstrating the working of the system. The following screenshots should be added:

8. Conclusion
The Hotel Management System provides an effective solution for managing hotel operations digitally. By automating reservations, guest management, the system reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and improves service quality. This project demonstrates how software engineering principles can be applied to solve real-world problems in the hospitality domain.
